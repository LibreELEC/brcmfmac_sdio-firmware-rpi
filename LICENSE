 .
 7.4.    Severability.  All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall, if
 possible, be construed in a manner which makes them valid, but in the event any
 term or provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent
 jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected if the illegal or
 unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent of this
 Agreement.  If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the
 intent of the parties to this Agreement, this Agreement shall become
 terminated.
 .
 7.5.    Equitable Relief.  Licensee hereby acknowledges that its breach of this
 Agreement would cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Broadcom that
 may be difficult to ascertain and that a remedy at law would be inadequate.
 Accordingly, Licensee agrees that Broadcom shall have the right to seek and
 obtain immediate injunctive relief to enforce obligations under the Agreement
 in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.
 .
 7.6.    Waiver.  The waiver of, or failure to enforce, any breach or default
 hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any other or subsequent breach or
 default.
 .
 7.7.    Entire Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth the entire Agreement
 between the parties and supersedes any and all prior proposals, agreements and
 representations between them, whether written or oral concerning the Software.
